                <h2>Got to know about neog.camp</h2>
                <p>Last week, I was just scrolling on twitter. Then I encountered the neog camp twitter handle. I like the idea of tanay’s neog.camp. It is basically a bootcamp specially designed on the basis of job oriented developer. It has different levels. Level 0 is mandatory to go to the next level which is paid. Yes level 0 is free and available on youtube. 
                    So paid ahhh! But then I found that there is a financial aid scheme in neog which is good news for me. Then I thought, ``Let's give it a try. Paid one, I can't afford it but I might get that financial aid.
